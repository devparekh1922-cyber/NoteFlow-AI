## 🎬 Quick Start: What to Say Right Now

When interviewer asks: **"Tell me about your project"**

Say this (modify to fit your voice):

> "I built NoteFlow-AI, a full-stack web application for note-taking with encryption and AI features. It's built with Next.js and React on the frontend, uses Context API for state management, and integrates with the Groq API for AI features. The key innovation is client-side encryption - users' passwords never leave their browser, and notes are AES-encrypted. When they create a note, it's saved to localStorage. They can also use AI to summarize, translate, or auto-tag their notes. I deployed it on Vercel. Would you like me to walk you through a specific feature or the architecture?"

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Shows you understand the full stack
- ✅ Highlights the security aspect (impressive)
- ✅ Mentions the AI integration
- ✅ Shows deployment knowledge
- ✅ Ends with engagement question
